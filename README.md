# Welcome
Hello, and thank you for reading this file!
I hope you're ready, because I have no idea how to write this.
My goal is to build a web application from scratch, starting by documenting some key initial decisions.
I'll assume you understand some programming and IT concepts and know git.
Without further ado, let's get started.

# Development & Editing Workspace
First, let's get this repository set up to be worked on.
I highly recommend using file based standards because they can dramatically reduce manual effort:
- [.editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/)
- [.devcontainer](https://containers.dev/implementors/spec/)
- [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)
We'll make use of those standards by editing in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) from the web via [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
Of course, if these are restricted or your preferences differ feel free to choose your own!
