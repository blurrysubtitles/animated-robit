# Welcome
Hello, and thank you for reading this file!
I hope you're ready, because I have no idea how to write this.
My goal is to build a web application from scratch, starting by documenting some key initial decisions.
I'll assume you understand some programming and IT concepts and know `git`.
Without further ado, let's get started.

# Getting Started
We're starting with this `README.md` file and an MIT `LICENSE.txt` file in a `git` repository.
There are options for repository hosts - I created mine on [GitHub](https://github.com/), but feel free to choose your own.
And that does it for the 2nd commit on the `main` branch!
