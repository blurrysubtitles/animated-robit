# Welcome
Hello, and thank you for reading this file!
I hope you're ready, because I have no idea how to write this.
My goal is to build a web application from scratch, starting by documenting some key initial decisions.
Without further ado, let's get started.

# Workspace Setup
I highly recommend using uncoupled file-based tools with clear specifications because they can improve maintainability, reduce tedium, and make work more fun.
Tools such as these also work well in source control, especially [git](https://git-scm.com/).
They often work in standalone applications or even extensions and plugins to other applications.
The tools used in this project are indexed in the table below.
That said, feel free to mix and match or use none at all - these may be unnecessary in other situations or even restricted for any number of reasons.
